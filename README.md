## Firebase Setup

Setup Firebase for Push Notification
First you have to change your package name. If you didnâ€™t then follow this.

Create your own firebase project from https://console.firebase.google.com and also add an android app there with your own package name and app name.

WARNING
Do not create multiple project if you have multiple app like User App, Delivery App. Create only one project and add multiple app under project.

Click register app and download google-services.json file from there.

Copy that file and paste it under <project>/android/app/ folder.

Create a totally white png logo for notification icon. Paste it on <project>/android/app/src/main/res/drawable/ and replace notification_icon.png with your whiter version logo.

For IOS again create an app under same project and download GoogleService-Info.plist and paste it under <project>/iOS/ folder. Also follow this documentation for full setup for IOS: https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/apple-integration


After your setup please restart your IDE and uninstall your previously installed app then run it. Also donâ€™t try to test it on emulator or simulator. Emulator and simulators are unable to get push. Use real device in this case.
